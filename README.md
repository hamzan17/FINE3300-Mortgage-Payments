# FINE3300-Mortgage-Payments
This  is a project which contains a python calculator to calculate the Canadian Mortgage Payments.
The calculator is essentially a simplified tool which finds the rate of 6 different payment frequencies for mortgages. It computes monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, rapid bi-weekly and rapid weekly payments by using the PVA or present value annuity formula where it substitues the principal for mortgage to find the original mortgage payments for each frequency. 

When running the code, you will be asked to provide the principal amount, the rate (as a %) and the amortization period in years. After inputting your variables, you will then be given the ouput in 6 different rows and the value for each frequency. 
It simplifies the calculations and allows you to calculate your mortgage payments easily.
